This project is a full-stack ToDo web application built with ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8) and Entity Framework Core using the Code First approach. It features secure user authentication (registration and login) with hashed password storage, session-based authorization, and complete CRUD functionality for task management. The application follows the MVC design pattern, with strongly-typed views and structured controllers. SQL Server is used as the backend database, hosted on Azure SQL Database. The application is deployed to Azure App Service, with environment-specific configurations and connection strings managed securely through Azureâ€™s configuration settings. This project demonstrates core enterprise-grade practices such as dependency injection, connection resiliency, model validation, and cloud-based deployment pipelines.
